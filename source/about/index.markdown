The Pace Linux User Group (otherwise known as P.L.U.G.) is a place of joy and Linux. All are welcome to join in the experiment, watching as we approach the long-term goal of the club: to create more Linux user groups in different high schools all over the world, and with it, new Linux users!

            <h1>Arturo Bory</h1>
            <h2>Vice-president</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Born from the kernel of Unix and coded in Pascal, Arturo has grown from his small beginnings on the streets of Zimbabwe to reach the level of vice-president of the Pace Linux User Group. He (or it) has been credited with the idea of starting a Linux user group, though as he/it is the one writing this, imagine he/it saying this humbly, or he/it might seem like a dick, which he/it may or may not be. She (is it a typo?) hopes to start more Linux user groups in different high schools to show the benefits of Linux to more and more people, with the eventual goal of having Linux be the new Windows and FreeBSD be the old Linux.</p>

            <h1>Kenan Yildirim</h1>
            <h2>Treasurer</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Drinks coffee and listens to dubstep. He's the club treasurer, but he's about to lose his position over a Python script he wrote that does all his work for him. He's the one to talk to if you have an issue with this site; he's the one who programmed it. Perhaps that makes him the club webmaster as well?</p>

            <h1>Alexis Almonte</h1>
            <h2>Secretary</h2>
        </header>
        <p>The illegitimate child of Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel, Alexis has amazing potential as a guitarist, and as an even greater achievement runs Linux on his computer. His witty sense of humor and gigantic pair of glasses have landed him a position as secretary of the Pace Linux User Group. And when this bio says "landed," it means forced, seeing as he needs some sort of extracurricular activity to get into a good college. He's welcome.</p>

            <h1>Juan Lopez</h1>
            <h2>Historian?</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Much like world peace, Juan Lopez is an urban legend. It is said that Juan Lopez is the historian of the Pace Linux User Group. There is no way to prove this, of course, because Juan Lopez has yet to show that he has used Linux. Maybe once this has been proved true, maybe he may become an actual person and officer of this club.</p>

## Initial setup

The P.L.U.G. site is a static site, generated by [Jekyll], a Ruby blog generator.

1. The [guard] gem that you'll use later requires Growl. If you're using Linux, that means you'll need Growl for Linux:
```bash
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mattn/growl-for-linux
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install growl-for-linux
```

2. If you don't have [RVM], it's time to get it. It'll let you install Ruby easily and switch versions smoothly
```bash
$ curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby
```

3. Close your current shell and open a new one

4. Run this. The output should be `rvm is a function`
```bash
$ type rvm | head -n 1
```

5. To finish the RVM installation, run this and do whatever it requires of you
```bash
$ rvm requirements
```

6. Now install Ruby
```bash
$ rvm install 1.9.3
$ rvm use 1.9.3
```

7. Get the repository
```bash
$ git clone git://github.com/KenanY/plugclub.org.git
$ cd octopress
```

8. When cd-ing into the folder, RVM will ask if you trust the .rvmrc file. Say yes.

9. Install dependencies (using the bundler gem)
```bash
$ gem install bundler
$ bundle install
```
